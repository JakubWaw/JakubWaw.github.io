I presented a scientific poster based on my Bachelor’s thesis, which investigated the impact of regular (projective) and Bell-type measurements on the dynamics of the Heisenberg spin chain. The project focused on understanding how different measurement schemes influence the time evolution and correlations within quantum many-body systems. My results revealed both significant similarities and clear structural differences in how these two types of measurements affect system dynamics. Importantly, the study did not remain purely qualitative — I performed a quantitative comparison of the observed effects using numerical simulations. This allowed for a systematic assessment of how measurement type alters entanglement behavior and dynamical properties of the system.
