About Me

I am a dedicated physicist with a strong foundation in theoretical and computational physics. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s (M.Sc.) degree in Technical Physics with a specialization in Theoretical Physics. My academic journey has equipped me with both deep theoretical insight and practical experience in quantum systems and numerical methods.

My Bachelor’s thesis focused on the impact of measurements—both regular projective and Bell-type—on the dynamics of quantum systems, with a particular emphasis on the dynamics of the Heisenberg spin chain. Building on this research, I am currently working on implementing neural networks to analyze and extract deeper insights from simulation results, bridging modern machine learning techniques with quantum physics.

Beyond my primary research, I have actively participated in a number of additional projects that expanded my experience across physics and computation. One project studied the percolation threshold in two-dimensional networks, exploring critical phenomena in statistical systems. I have also taken part in several hackathons and teamwork challenges, including:
 - a hybrid classical–quantum optimization algorithms challenge,
 - a quantum error mitigation project, and
 - an innovative quantum games hackathon where my team developed a quantum-inspired Sudoku solver—and won first place.

Conferences and Scientific Engagement

I have presented my work and engaged with the international physics community at numerous student-focused scientific events. These include the 38th International Conference of Physics Students (ICPS 2024) held in Tbilisi, Georgia—a major annual conference bringing together physics students from around the world to share and discuss research across all fields of physics.

I have also participated in the Physics for Physicists (P4P) student conference in Skopje, North Macedonia, in 2025, and the International Physics Student Conference SMOK 2025 in Kraków, Poland.

In addition to presenting research, I am actively involved with the Polish Society of Physics Students (PSSF), contributing to the organization of student events, workshops, and scientific communities dedicated to physics education and collaboration.
