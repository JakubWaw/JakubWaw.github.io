In addition to my academic work, I provide private tutoring in physics and mathematics. I focus on building deep conceptual understanding rather than rote problem-solving, tailoring each session to the student’s individual needs and level of preparation. I make extensive use of modern online tools for real-time collaboration, including interactive whiteboards, simulation platforms, and visual presentation software, which allow me to clearly illustrate complex concepts and maintain effective communication during remote sessions. My goal is not only to help students achieve strong results, but also to develop their confidence and analytical thinking skills.
